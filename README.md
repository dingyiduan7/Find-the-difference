# Find-the-difference
Find the difference on the second image from the first one, then mark it in red. 

A quick and simple project:

- Given a random image.
- Make a copy of it to make sure the two images are the same size.
- Randomly add some markups on the copy.
- Inspect pixel by pixel to find the differences.
- Overlay the differences on the copy to make the constrast image (the third image).
- Display all three images.
